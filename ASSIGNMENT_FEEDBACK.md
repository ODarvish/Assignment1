Great job fixing up the assignemnt Omid!

The only thing left that I would like you to do is to change the dirretory and file names - Files and directories should be written in lowercase

But that will be for your own knowledge, as you can see below you've fixed everything so I am happy to say you have achieved a Välgodkänt grade! Well done!

So please fix those file & folder names if you like, but you don't need to resubmit. Congratulations!

Hi Omid! Nice work!

I found a few issues, the main ones are:

File paths - because of the file paths the links and the image are not being found. You should just need to remove a word and remember that ../ refers to the parent directory and ./ refers to the current directory

Using float: please remove all floats and use flex box instead.

Duplicate CSS - see the comments below.

Can you please make the changes, push to github and let me know when I can take another look?
